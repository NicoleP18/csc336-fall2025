        <h1> Bon Bon Sushi Burrito</h1>

        <p>
            Bon Bon Sushi was my favorite restaurant in high school. They made something called a "Sushi Burrito", which has since been
            popularized, but at the time, was still fairly new and inventive. Despite it's popularization, no one has been able to 
            replicate both the impressiveness and deliciousness of Bon Bon's very own. I brought everyone I knew to
            Bon Bon, and even convinced one of my teachers to let us leave to get sushi burritos for the class senior year, just so everyone 
            could try them. Unbeknownst to us, that would be the last sushi burrito I, or any of us, would ever eat. The restaurant suddenly 
            closed- ironically, because it receive too much business. I was so devastated that I sent the owner an email to let him know how much I loved
            his classic sushi burritos. It unfortunately was not enough for him to stay open. Let this website be a tribute to Bon Bon, since their
            page is no longer active.
