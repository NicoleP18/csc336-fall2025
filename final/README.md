# Nickie's final

My app is a site where my mom can track the books that she reads so she can remember what she has liked, disliked, and when she
has read different things.

It already has a curated list of some of her favorite books, and then she can add books as she reads them, including facts about them such as : title, author, rating 1-5, month and year read, and other notes such as if it was for her book club, who reccomended it to her, and any other things of interest or of note. 

I used the micromodal external library to create a popup to explain the website on the home page of my website

Nothing else- thank you!!
